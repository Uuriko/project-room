# QA Mutation Probes

Mutation-testing ledger for John's 200-agent QA wave (2026-10-08), mutation lane.
Workers append rows here; **never re-probe a recorded CAUGHT row** — the suite
already pins that behavior.

Columns: probe | worker | target (file) | mutation | verdict | pinning test(s) | notes.

| probe | worker | target | mutation | verdict | pinning test(s) | notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| qa200-mut-21-A | qa200-mut-21 (coord qa200-mutation) | server/work-claim-integrity.mjs `assertBoardEventBudget` | Gate disabled: early `return` — writes allowed past the budget floor | CAUGHT | tests/work-claim-integrity.test.js "board input rules … event budget" (`assert.throws … 409 room_event_budget_low`) | Fails red at test.js:440 "Missing expected exception". Route-level test also pins the 409. |
| qa200-mut-21-B | qa200-mut-21 (coord qa200-mutation) | server/work-claim-integrity.mjs `roomEventsRemaining` | Counter undercounts: `eventsPerRoom - floor(sequence/2)` — writes appear not to consume budget | CAUGHT | tests/work-claim-integrity.test.js "with under 10% of the event budget left…" (route) + "board input rules … event budget" (`roomEventsRemaining(limit-5) === 5`) | Both route and pure tests fail under the mutation. End-to-end counter tracking pinned by `status.eventsRemaining === limit - sequence` after real writes. |
| qa200-mut-21-C | qa200-mut-21 (coord qa200-mutation) | server/work-claim-routes.mjs call sites (lines 519/551/760) | Privilege flattened: `{ privileged: true }` for all writers at <10% budget left | CAUGHT | tests/work-claim-integrity.test.js "with under 10% of the event budget left only the owner and claim managers write" | Non-privileged `contrib` write no longer refused → route test fails. Pure unit (`privileged:false` throws, `privileged:true` passes) also pins the distinction. |
