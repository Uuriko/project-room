# QA Mutation Probes

Mutation-testing ledger for the QA wave (fail-first probes). Each row is one
probe: the mutation applied, whether existing tests caught it, and the
outcome. Workers: never re-probe a row marked CAUGHT.

Columns: probe id · target file · mutation · tests run · caught? · hardening

| Probe | Target | Mutation | Tests | Caught? | Hardening |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| MUT-15 A | server/claim-coordination.mjs | added `"done"` to `LIVE_CLAIM_STATES` (double-settle allowed) | tests/claim-settle-1526.test.js, tests/work-claim-batch-outcome.test.js, tests/work-claim-settle-missing-link.test.js (15 tests) | **UNCAUGHT** (15/15 green under mutation) | tests/work-claim-settle-double.test.js — red with break (1 fail), green without (2 pass); PR #2032 |
| MUT-15 B | server/claim-coordination.mjs | `pullsReadyToSettle` forced to `return true` (missing/invalid pull-link guard bypassed) | same settle suite (15 tests) | **CAUGHT** (1 fail: claim-settle-1526 asserts `pullsReadyToSettle` is false with only open links) | none needed; mutation reverted |
| MUT-15 C | server/bounty-escrow.mjs | duplicated the refund `_move` leg in `rejectWork` (funds move twice) | tests/bounty-free-miss.test.js (12 tests) | **CAUGHT** (5 fail: balance conservation, no-new-journal-rows, single settlement event) | none needed; mutation reverted |
