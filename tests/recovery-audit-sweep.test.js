// A gate for one bug class, found three times in one day.
//
// auditRecovery runs four auditors - text results, charters, reply requests and
// work help - and each replays the event log into its own narrower model, then
// asserts that model deep-equals the live projection. Any legitimate event an
// auditor does not implement makes the two disagree PERMANENTLY: no later event
// restores agreement. And auditRecovery gates backupRoom and loops every room,
// so a single such event in a single room stops the entire database being
// backed up, while nothing whatever is corrupt.
//
// Found this way, not by reading:
//   * auditReplyRequests skipped message.edited / message.deleted, so any edit
//     in a room holding a reply request broke backups.
//   * auditCharters never followed ownership.transferred, so the first transfer
//     broke them.
//   * auditCharters also required the owner to be human, so every room made by
//     POST /api/agent-rooms broke them the moment it was created.
//
// So the gate is not "test the auditors", it is "drive the room through every
// event type the product has and require the audit to survive each one". A new
// event type that no auditor models should fail here, naming itself, on the
// commit that introduces it.
//
// Checked against the bugs that motivated it rather than assumed: reverting the
// reply-request fix makes this fail naming message.posted, message.edited and
// message.deleted; reverting the charter fix makes it fail naming
// ownership.transferred.
//
// It does NOT catch the third one, and that is worth stating plainly. Editing a
// message bound as completion evidence needs a particular order - complete with
// room_text evidence, then edit that exact message - which a linear sweep of
// event types never produces. A sweep catches "this event type was never
// modelled"; it cannot catch "this combination was never considered". That one
// is pinned by tests/work-evidence-immutable.test.js, and its existence is the
// reason not to treat this file as covering the class on its own.
