// RC-2026-09-19-078 — account-deletion wiring.
//
// src/account-deletion.mjs plans WHAT to purge in WHAT order but never
// touches the store. This module is the execution side: it builds the
// purge inventory from the live store, signs short-lived confirmation
// tokens (confirm-then-delete), and executes the plan — actually deleting
// the account's data. The retention policy is documented in
// RETENTION_POLICY and served at GET /api/account/retention.
//
// Deletion flow:
//   1. GET /api/account/deletion/plan -> inventoryFromStore + planDeletion
//      + summarizePurge + a confirmation token bound to (account, plan, 10m).
//   2. POST /api/account/delete { confirmationToken } -> the token is
//      verified against a freshly rebuilt plan (changed data 409s as
//      plan_changed), then executeAccountDeletion runs the purge steps in
//      order inside one transaction.
